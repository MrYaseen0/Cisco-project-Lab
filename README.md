# Small Office Network Project

Welcome to the **Small Office Network** project using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project simulates a small office network divided into four distinct networks:

* **Server Room**
* **Chairman Room**
* **IT Department**
* **Computer Department**

This README file will guide you through the installation process, help you get started with Cisco Packet Tracer, and provide steps for configuring end devices, switches, and routers.
